# Bike Store Dashboard (Power Bi)
## Description
The dashboard was created to display a wide range of information taken from data cleaned with Power Query. It displays the most important parts of sales in a simple way to present them to people at all levels. The dashboard is interactive and each table has a scroll-down feature to ensure that all the viewer's needs are satisfied. The project not only focuses on the company's products sold and its profits categorized by category, type, country, and state
